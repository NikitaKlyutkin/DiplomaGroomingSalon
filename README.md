### About the diploma

A system has been developed to enable customers to order grooming services and complete their orders conveniently online. A price list has been created for the salon administrator's ease of use, which automatically displays for each service when placing an order.

Additionally, customers can schedule appointments with salon professionals for a specific time. To prevent overloading the professionals, the system automatically blocks off time if there are less than two hours remaining until the appointment.

The system also includes a feature for viewing and changing order statuses, allowing customers and administrators to track the order fulfillment process. These innovations significantly simplified the process of ordering grooming services and increased its efficiency.
